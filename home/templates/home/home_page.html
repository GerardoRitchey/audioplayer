        <h2>Next Iteration of DLBRadio</h2>
        <p class="text-subtle">Currently Incomplete</p>
        <p>This app was built as a server-side technical and learning exercise on Django and Wagtail.</p>

        <p><em>UI/UX on this is/was an afterthought.</em></p>

        <p>The decision to add Single Page Application functionality came much later, and is incredibly
        evident in the JavaScript files and the mix-and-match grid/flex CSS.</p>


        <p>This web app is built using the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Django Web Framework</li>
            <li>Wagtail CMS</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js">Howler.js</a></li>
            <li>Bootstrap5</li>
            <li>Demo Tracks by <a href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/">Scott Buckley</a> used under the Creative Commons 4 license By Scott Buckley</li>
            <li>Demo Artwork generated using Midjourney AI</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The data serving and restful API to retrieve data from the models is complete.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript that fetches the data on the otherhand... well it works, but it is not remotely close to clean</p>

        <p>There will be another version of this project built with a specific intent from the beginning for it to be
        a single page application, and Django/Wagtail will only serve as the server-side back end for the application.</p>
